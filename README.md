# Three_dimensional_strain_tomography
Demonstration of full-field triaxial strain tomography from neutron transmission strain images. Strain images were RADEN energy-resolved-neutron-imaging instrument at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) in Japan. This repository contains companion code to the PAPER, and has matlab example scripts to reconstruct and plot the comparisons given in the paper.

Hyperparameters for the Gaussian process covariance functions have been prechosen by performing an optimisation to maximise the Marginal Log Likelihood. This process takes several days and so is not included in the example scripts.
