# Three_dimensional_strain_tomography
Demonstration of full-field triaxial strain tomography from neutron transmission strain images. Strain images were RADEN energy-resolved-neutron-imaging instrument at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) in Japan. This repository contains companion code to the PAPER, and has matlab example scripts to reconstruct and plot the comparisons given in the paper.
